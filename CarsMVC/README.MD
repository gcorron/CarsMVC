This is a simple app I developed, along with another app, CarsInCSharp, to refresh the following skillset:

* C#
* VB.NET (Another project I wrote translated from C#)
* ASP.NET, MVC, WebAPI
* Git
* SQL Server tables and stored procedures
* Javascript, JQuery, HTML, XML, CSS
* Bootstrap, Dapper, Caliburn Micro MVVM.

It has been quite a ride - about two months of solid work and research. StackOverflow was an invaluable reference.

The source code for the Corron.CarService class library can be found in a separate VS solution, CarsInCSharp. It includes the base model classes, a data-level class, and a project containing the complete SQL database schema.

This project, and the CarsInCSharp solution, were developed with VS 2017 community edition. The database was developed on SQL Server Express, version 14.
